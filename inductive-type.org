* Inductive and Coinductive Types
Inductive Types are a form of types specified by inductive definitions. These definitions are solutions to "type equations" like

\[
N = \mathtt{unit} + N
\]

The smallest solution to such a type equation is the inductive type and the largest is the coinductive type. 
* TODO the poster remarks that the solutions are the "initial algebra" and the "final coalgebra". How?
