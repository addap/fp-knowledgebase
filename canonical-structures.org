#+TITLE: Canonical Structures
Canonical Structures (should really be named Canonical Instances) allows you to insert a new rule into the unification algorithm of Coq (i.e. when it checks if two types can be unified T ~ T') by specifying an instance of a record as the "canonical" choice when the unification algorithm is presented with a problem of the form "x ~ proj_i ?T".
So it can help fill the hole of this ?T because Coq alone cannot come up with some record instance satsifying it.

The paper is suprisingly well readable and explains the concept very well. Their example is mostly about unifying some type with one that is inside a record but they also give an interesting generalization to unifying terms by lifting terms on the level of types with phantom types.
