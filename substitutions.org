* Description
  Substitutions play a crucial role in the operational semantics of the lambda calculus because we naturally need them in the beta reduction rule to substitute for the bound variable.
  For implementations it's often easier to represent variables using de Bruijn indices, and using parallel substitution that acts on all variables in a term simultaneously (so we don't need to worry about order, i.e. that a later substitution act on the result of an earlier subsitution). In this case subsitutions are total functions from the natural numbers.
