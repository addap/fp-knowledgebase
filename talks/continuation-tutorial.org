algebraic effects vs control operators
If you define effects with control operators you need to define the behavior directly. With algebraic effects you can do it at the use site

the typing statement for continuations is similar to `parameterized monads` apparently. and there should be a paper about it by someone names felinsky. This might be the references she used.
