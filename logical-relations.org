#+TITLE: Logical Relations

Logical Relations are a certain kind of relation although I do not know a precise definition.
One inherent feature seems to be that functions that belong to the relation preserve the relation-ness of their arguments.
They are sometimes used in normalization proofs.

* Resources
** TODO chapter 12.2 in TAPL gives a whole lot of papers on it
** TODO One of the papers of Eirjou Sumii had an overview on the differences between logical relations and bisimulations
** TODO On of the rsources in [[file:theorems-for-free.org][theorems for free]] also deals with logical relations
